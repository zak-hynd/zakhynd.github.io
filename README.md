## About this repository...
In the absence of any creative inspiration, or grand enthusiasm for sharing a lot about myself, I'll just start rambling...

So, I'm taking this (Dev Academy)[https://devacademy.co.nz/] course... wait, this is a markdown file... why is that link being a dick?
As part of the stretch-materials (extra for experts/bored/nothingbettertodo) for the second week of the course, it was suggested that we explore markdown a bit and edit this README.md file.

>Some ideas for exploration are:
>
>- A short bio about you.
>- Document your learning progress in web development.
>- Provide a detailed run-down of your blog features and style choices.
>- Share blog planning diagrams and wireframe images.
>- Create a table of contents for your blog repo and include short summaries of what each file in the repo is doing.
>- Talk about code snippets or coding concepts you enjoyed and feel proud of that are found in your blog repo.
>- Outline version notes and what you might have planned for future project versions. 

...yea, I'm not feeling motivated for any of these (at the time of writing), but maybe I can come back to that later...
