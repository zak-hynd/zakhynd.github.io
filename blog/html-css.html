        A website without good positioning is like a circus of squirrels trying to perform synchronised swimming - chaos everywhere, with elements crashing, overlapping, and completely missing their marks!

        <p><b>Exercise brief:</b> Research one of 4 possible topics from a list of concepts that were covered during this sprint. Write a blog post that teaches others how and when to use each thing. 
        <b>Topic chosen:</b> <i>"What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?"</i></p>
        <h2>Positioning!</h2>
        <p>The question asks about the differences between three types of positioning, but, from my quick research (which probably STILL took far longer than the timebox recommendations!), it appears that there are five types: Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed, Sticky.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm going to try to demonstrate each of these positioning types by referencing an element that I‚Äôve used on my home blog page. I wanted to change the basic styles for the links to my blog pages, so I put a * before the link text using this class:</p>
        <p><code>.subpage-links a::before {
        content: "‚Ä¢";
        }</code></p>
        <i>[^^ugh I need to figure out how to better style code]</i>
        <p>But this is what they looked like:</p>
        <img src="https://github.com/zak-hynd/zak-hynd.github.io/blob/main/blog/resources/htmlcss01.jpg?raw=true" alt="static positioning" width=auto height=100 />
        <p>They all have the default positioning: <b>static</b>.</p>
        <p>If I set the positioning to <b>relative</b>, and tell it to move left and down a bit, this moves the element relative to that original static position.</p>
        <img src="https://github.com/zak-hynd/zak-hynd.github.io/blob/main/blog/resources/htmlcss02.jpg?raw=true" alt="relative positioning" width=auto height="100" />
        <p>If I instead use <b>absolute</b> positioning, this sets the element‚Äôs ‚Äúorigin‚Äù, it‚Äôs ‚Äúreference position‚Äù relative to its nearest positioned ‚Äúancestor‚Äù... which, in this case, is ???the position of the div class that contains it, or if that doesn‚Äôt have positioning, it‚Äôs the ancestor above that, and so on‚Ä¶ I think.</p>
        <img src="https://github.com/zak-hynd/zak-hynd.github.io/blob/main/blog/resources/htmlcss03.jpg?raw=true" alt="absolute positioning" width=auto height="100" />
        <p>Fixed positioning is fixed relative to the viewport; so when you scroll the elements can appear like they‚Äôre floating over the page. Like eye floaters!</p>
        <i>[^^It's difficult to capture that behaviour in a screenshot!]</i>
        <p><b>Sticky</b> positioning doesn‚Äôt appear to affect my wee elements here in any noticeable way. But from what I understand, it allows the positioning to flip-flop between relative and fixed. A good use case of which is the sorts of headings on pages that stay floating until you scroll past a certain point.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôd like to delve deeper, but I‚Äôve already spent too much time faffing around with this one!</p>
