            <p>Who you are and what you bring shapes your learning journey. This exploration requires you to examine and reflect on your identity and start to articulate what's at the core of who you are.</p>

        <p><b>Preamble:</b> Upon creating and filling in this page with the questions I answered last week, I'm wondering if I have misunderstood <i>how</i> I'm supposed to have completed this exercise. In the end, I just went question to question, rather than write some form of structured essay that addresses each question... but <i>that</i> would probably have taken far more effort than what the timeboxing allows for. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

        <h2>Tahi</h2>
        <b>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </b><p>
        An ethical decision… man, I’m finding it hard to think of something non-trivial. I am so tempted to deflect the seriousness of this with humour (as I often do!).
        </p><p>If I am to think of something trivial, to get the ball rolling, I might consider a recent decision to reduce the amount of recycling that I do…
        </p><p>“Wooah, what?!”</p>
        <p>I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t a degree of laziness contributing to my decision-making, but there is a bit more to it than that. Firstly, there’s been a lack of consistency around the country, and the world, about what can and can’t be recycled, based on the sorting and processing capabilities - this is messy, annoying, and can really erode any goodwill that everyday people might have for the efforts.   Recycling isn’t exactly a cheap endeavour for councils - especially when a lot of folks don’t follow the guidelines, putting too many ‘contaminants’ (dirty items or things that the local plant can’t process well), resulting in entire recycling hauls just being sent to landfill. So if much of it is simply going to landfill anyway, what’s the point of wasting money trying to recycle it?!
        </p><p>
            The subject of value leads me to question whether the efforts to recycle material are exceeded (or matched) by the rewards… I’ve heard of fence posts being made of recycled plastics, which is awesome, and there’s glass being used in roading/construction aggregate, but what other industrial-scale uses are there for it? (I could probably research this and feel marginally better about it afterwards, but I won’t just now).
        </p><p>Finally, the oil and gas industry, particularly large companies like ExxonMobil and Shell, have been involved in promoting and funding recycling initiatives for decades. This involvement has been interpreted by some critics as an effort to shift responsibility for environmental damage onto consumers, rather than addressing the more significant issue of fossil fuel consumption.
        </p><p>So, although I still make sure to put my glass, aluminium, and paper in the recycling, I have stopped concerning myself for plastic packaging - if in doubt, throw it out (landfill).  I am mildly optimistic that in the mid-near-term future, technology will improve to the point where mining our landfills for certain compounds will become economically feasible.

        <h2>Dos</h2>
        <b>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</b>
        <p>Skip!  Identity~~something to do with outdoors (family), something to do with science (some family, mainly friends)... values…: interest in science eventually leading to a rejection/skepticism/trivialising of pseudoscience, superstition, spirituality and all things that can’t be observed and measured objectively.

        <h2>Þrír</h2>
        <b>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
        </b>
        <p>Strengths!</p><p>
            Supposedly humour is one of my strengths… more thought needed; I did take three of those personality quizes.
        </p>

        <h2>Quatre</h2>
        <b>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</b>
        <p>weaknesses!</p><p>
            Uh oh… yea I have lots of personality/character flaws that could hamstring my efforts here on this course. Am I going to write them all down? Ugh, do I have to?
            </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Fünf</h2>
        <b>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</b>
        <p>
            Oh the classic job interview question “describe a time when there was conflict, and what happened, how you behaved, what was the outcome…” Ok
        </p> <p>
            My go-to prepared answer for this is a story about when my team was getting close to releasing a new web service (a data repository). My role was as a product owner (project manager), curating the backlog. We were trying to discuss which issues to address for the release, and I was advocating for doing only the essential issues, minimising complexity, so that we can focus our attention on anything unexpected that may blow up in our face when we hit the “go” button.
        </p> <p>
            The tester in the team was strongly advocating for fixing a bunch of minor issues (mainly consistencies in text formatting). While I agreed that those issues should be dealt with, I suggested we address them immediately AFTER release. Things got quite heated, unfortunately.
        </p> <p>
            I suggested a compromise, which allowed us to move forward - we would do a couple of the most severe formatting inconsistencies, and the rest could wait.  Win.
        </p> <p>
            Conclusion: we released on time, had some minor hiccups which we address, then the next day we re-released with a bunch of the other formatting issues the tester wanted fixed. Success. A few weeks later, the tester told me that in all her years at this organisation, this was the first project she had been involved with which released on time.
