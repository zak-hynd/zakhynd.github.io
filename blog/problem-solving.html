            The section below is written using markdown. I'm getting sick of writing stuff in html, so I thought I'd try something new. For the most part, it seems to be rendering <i>acceptably</i>, but newlines don't work as I expect them to, and I haven't figured out how to do a blockquote without exiting the md-block element.

# Discus ü•è
**Tell your non-tech friend a story about...**

## Blocked on a simple problem

I was trying to complete the ~~fizzbuzz~~ flipflop challenge where I had to take a number and change that number under certain conditions. I was confident that my solution worked, at least for the first parts of the challenge, but the tests kept failing on me.

**What problem-solving techniques did you use?**  I often chunk a problem up by writing some pseudocode, and google/search for methods that I can use and how to use them. But I don't really consider those to be what I used in order to troubleshoot this particular problem.
- I tried reading the error messages, but they weren't particularly helpful - they just said my results were "undefined".
- I tried checking the test file to see what the criteria were that were being thrown at my code.
- I tried console-logging the results of each part of my code - that had mixed success because most of the time the console.log doesn't work while running the test suite! So I would end up copying-out my code to run in a separate file that is disconnected to the test framework. There I could see that my code was fine.
- I tried the rubber ducky method with an AI chatbot, and it was helpful, but didn't fully understand the context of the testing framework, so wasn't fruitful.
- I was _about_ to call out for help in the Discord channel, starting to type out my issue (more rubber ducky), when I looked closer at what the test results were saying... they were referring to another file that I had been thinking was meant for another challenge!

**How did I feel during this troubleshooting phase?** Well it was quite frustrating. A little humbling. It was getting late in the afternoon, and my energy levels were dropping, so I parked my efforts on this challenge and moved on to the next one for a bit before calling it quits for the day.

**What did I learn?** Well I learned to pay more attention to *ALL* the text that the test results throw at you, despite some of it seeming like gibberish at first glance.  I also learned how to reference/call/use code that is written in another file.

## Elegantly solved a problem

**What was the problem?** Well, to avoid overthinking this exercise, I'm just going to use the first problem that came to my head, despite not being a particularly challenging one!  So there was a challenge where we had to take some text which had the word "buzz" scattered through it, and we had to return the text sentence without the buzz. I simply used a method called split() to split up that text at every instance of ' buzz', then rejoin all the split pieces of the sentence. 

**What problem-solving techniques did I use?** My technique worked perfectly for the first part of the challenge, and I didn't actually need to employ any problem solving techniques: that was my first try.
However, it didn't pass the second test, which threw a bunch of different variants of 'buzz' with different capitalised letters. So, my elegant solution needed to evolve, and I employed some pseudocoding, trying different methods, console.logging the results of each stage, and searching online for what javascript methods can be used for certain things.

**How did you feel throughout the process?** Fine, this wasn't a particularly intense problem to solve, so I just calmly stepped through the parts, improving and learning as I went. It didn't take that long.

**What did you learn?** Ooof, I can't remember! Probably learnt a lot more about certain methods, but there was a lot of that in these series of exercises. For one, I recall trying to use the 'includes()' method because find() doesn't work on a string... However, I then found out that the way I was using that method didn't solve the challenge, so I had to step back and use find() since it returns the FIRST instance of something.
...well, that's rambly.

## Reflect: confidence with problem-solving techniques/processes

* **Pseudocode** - I think I'm ok with this. I could always be more disciplined about using it for the challenges I face, get more practice writing it, but I don't find it always necessary.
* **Trying something** - trying... yea that's kind of my default! Trying something, if I have an idea, and checking the results. Iterate.
* **Rubber ducky method** - I probably should try this more often when struggling with an issue. Write down, even just to myself, what the problem is that I'm witnessing - as if I'm about to ask for help. 
* **Reading error messages** - YES... this one I need to pay more attention to!
* **Console.logging** - always a good one to use - that's if the damned console will work!
* **Googling** - I should possibly get more familiar with this
* **Asking your peers for help** - ...I haven't needed to so far, but once we're in bootcamp I assume it'll be much easier to do. And more necessary.
* **Asking coaches for help** - I _almost_ reached out for help yesterday morning for the flipflop problem, as I said earlier. Yep, I don't want to be annoying, but if I'm stuck on something, I will try to swallow my reluctances and ask. 
* **Improving your process with reflection** - splash my face with water to wake up and look at how haggard I am in the mirror? Oh, not _that_ reflection. Yea, this seems related to psuedocoding and rubby-ducky, where simply thinking about, and writing, a problem can help break it down and illuminate where things are going wrong. I should do this more often.

## Reluctance to ask for help
**Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?**

Well well well, didn't I already answer this earlier?

Haaaaah the stuperFlipFlop.

I considered crying for help several times, but I was reluctant, primarily because I wanted to be able to troubleshoot it _myself_, learn those skills! However, I am cognizant about committing tooo much time on a problem, diminishing returns, sunken cost fallacy, all the other fallacies.

Since I had initially thought that maybe something was wrong with my tests' code, I didn't want to sound like an idiot requesting for help when I was entirely wrong about that... which I was! So there's the issue of letting go of the ego, right. That's something else to swallow.
