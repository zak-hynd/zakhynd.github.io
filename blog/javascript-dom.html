        <a href="https://student-handbook.devacademy.life/foundations/curriculum/sprint-3/02-tech/t3-js-dom-primer/d6-research">research the DOM,</a>
         and write a blog post which strengthen your understanding of:
         <ul>
            <li>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</li>
            <li>Functions and why they are useful</li>
            <li>The DOM and DevTools</li>
         </ul>
       </div>

       
       <p>
        Well I don't exactly cover devTools in this blog, but I sure as hell used it a lot to check things out and make sure that I'm not  lying!

       <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>

      <!-- first section  -->

      <h2>What is JS, and how does it fit with HTML and CSS?</h2>
      <p>
        Daniel Thé has a good intro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78">video here.</a>
        Where she uses several useful analogies. Similarly to a country like Belgium, which has 3 official languages (German, French, and <s>Dutch</s> Flemish), the internet has 3 primary languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        She calls them the Tres Amigos - the builder (HTML), the artist (CSS), and the “wizard” (JS).
        </p><p>
        Now I don’t <i>love</i> this analogy, it’s far from perfect
        <comment>(since when do you need to invoke magic to get productive stuff done between a builder and an artist?? A half-decent Product/Project Manager will do!!!)</comment>
        , but the analogy is good enough for the purpose of introducing them at a high level:
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): Structures the content.</li>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): Styles the content.</li>
          <li>JavaScript (JS): Adds interactivity and dynamic behaviour.</li>
        </ul>       
      </p>
      <h3>Why three languages? Why not one?</h3>
      <p>
        In the beginning, in the 1980’s, there was HTML which was used for all the webpage content, providing elements for various headings, links, paragraphs, etc.
        <br> CSS was developed in the mid 90’s. It was designed to separate the page/document styling from the structure, and allowed pages to be styled much more efficiently.
        <br> Roughly a year later JS was created to create interactivity within pages.
        <br> As web development evolved, these three languages were adapted, the modularity of distinct functionality was useful, and they became the standard of web development, supported by all web browsers.
        <br>If, hypothetically, a new language was introduced to replace these three amigos, backwards compatibility would become an issue.
        </p><p>
          Now is a good time to segue to the DOM…
      </p>

      <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that allows programs to manipulate the document’s (the page’s) structure, style, and content. The DOM is an Application Programming Interface (API), which is a set of tools and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.
        <br>All the initialisms!
        <br>
        <comment> DOM, API, HTML, CSS, JS, BS, LOL</comment>
        <br><br>
        So the DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but it does allow JavaScript to interact with the webpage and do its magic.  On that note, the DOM can also be used by other programming languages, such as Python.
        <br><br>
        The DOM is often referred to as a tree structure, a hierarchical tree of nodes. Each node represents an HTML element that can be called on and manipulated by a program/code, usually JavaScript.
