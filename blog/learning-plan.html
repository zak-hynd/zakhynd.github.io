        This programme is not a traditional programme. It depends a lot on your motivation and organisation as a learner. This leads to a more individualised experience and increased learning skills moving forward. To facilitate this experience, each student creates a unique Learning Plan.

          # Week 5 stuff
          ## Long term goal &/or career pathway

Oh this one again\! Y‚Äôknow the first thing that comes to mind is:

>Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players, and electrical tin openers... Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life... But why would I want to do a thing like that?
 
‚Ä¶but back to the serious question. I won‚Äôt bother checking if things have changed, that‚Äôll spoil the fun. I actually assume that my answer hasn‚Äôt changed in 3 weeks. Except, well, I have been offered a job in Western Australia; project managing a several-year-long geophysics exploration project, with helicopters, so that‚Äôs new.  Otherwise, my rationale for doing this course hasn‚Äôt changed:

* I want the skills; coding is something that I‚Äôve only ever really lightly dabbled in, and I‚Äôve always wanted to be capable of more; solve all the problems!
<span><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/28j2cg.jpg" width="1rem" height="auto"></span>
  Especially when it comes to solving geospatial data-sciencey kinda problems.  
* I want to give myself more career options \- economy/employment-wise things are pretty grim right now; if I can‚Äôt find a job in geoscience or software product management, maybe I can pick up some work coding.  
* It‚Äôs something to do‚Ä¶ If it‚Äôs challenging to even get a job doing temp labouring work, then try something else. Upskill.  I‚Äôve thought that I could perhaps go do an MBA, or MSc after this DA course. I actually think the human skills component of this course (and the tech) will set me up well for either of those\!

## Strengths & Limitations

*Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2\. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?*

Hahaha ok. I‚Äôve just reread them. I am probably a little less concerned about my weaknesses. I think there will be enough [social facilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_facilitation) to keep my procrastination in check. And if we have regular interaction with our Tech- and Human-skills facilitators, this will be amplified.

As for strengths‚Ä¶ no change‚Ä¶ as long as my humour isn‚Äôt taken the wrong way (yes, the onus is also on me to read-the-room, notice when humour may not go down well in certain situations).

Have any new strengths/weaknesses cropped up in the last few weeks? Nope, none that I can think of right now.

## Biggest non-technical challenge

Asking for help might be one of them \- at least the first thing that springs to mind. Why? I think I‚Äôve covered this elsewhere in reflections files‚Ä¶ Several reasons, mostly unhelpful: appearing dumb, not wanting to bother someone, feeling like I ought to learn better by pushing through myself.  
Also, if we‚Äôre to speak in front of the group, and this is a kind of ‚Äòpresentation‚Äô sort of thing, I might be nervous about that. Public speaking‚Ä¶ something that I‚Äôve always tried to avoid, except for that time I attended a few toastmasters sessions.

## Human Skills development

All the things\! I would like to practise mindfulness, recognising my emotions, and doing something productive to improve them.  Reflective skills \- same sort of logic \- improve how I feel about something, and improve my chances of learning and understanding.  
Leadership skills, yea, that could be great to hone those in a safe space. Courage to be vulnerable: asking for help, admitting that I don‚Äôt understand (and hopefully getting a decent boost of understanding in doing so).  
Communication skills‚Ä¶ not that I think I‚Äôve ever struggled with them, it never hurts to test them, reflect on whether I am doing as well as I might have thought I could‚Ä¶ I have a preference for text-based communication, partly because it‚Äôs unintrusive, asynchronous, the recipient will read it when they can. But sometimes that preference becomes a reluctance to have real-time communication, and there‚Äôs not really any substitute for that. Don‚Äôt be so shy\!

## Expectations

**Facilitators\!:**  
I expect to be able to call up a facilitator at a moment‚Äôs notice, at any time of day/night. Drop the baby, I want to know how I could have structured this code to be more memory-efficient\! I want my page loads to be 10% faster\!  
I would like it if tech facilitators could give me tips on improving my code, without me having to bug them for those tips. But, I don‚Äôt know how intense the job of a facilitator is, nor what they get paid, so I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying that this is an expectation of mine\!  
I would also like that facilitators understand each of us individuals, and have a sense for our strengths and weaknesses, and help guide us, bespoke-like.

**Me:**  
Why are students being forced to make commitment declarations? Is this some new trend? An old colleague told me about a ‚Äòcourse‚Äô being taught internally at the company I used to work for, where the instructor insisted everyone sign a commitment to dedicate themselves fully to the training‚Äîcompletely unironically, in a place where nobody ever has time for anything. We laughed at the absurdity of it.

I formally commit to doing the course material, engaging (unironically(_mostly_)) with all tasks. I commit to attempting to better myself, especially when it comes to asking for help in a timely manner. I aim to get up earlier, exercise regularly, proactively prepare myself for the day, and productively present at postworks (coworking space) <span class="comment"> - unless the weather is shitting itself, because it is spring, the season of betrayal, after all!</span>

          <h1>Week 2 stuff</h1>
      
          <h2>1. Long term goal or career pathway</h2>
            <p>That's not an easy question. I suspect that given the current economic situation, like many folks, I've thought about this question a lot.
                 I enjoy working in tech, and I like living in Te Waipounamu (the South Island), particularly CHC.
                 I enjoy Product Management/Ownership, and enjoy scientific/technical domains, especially 'geospatial'. 
                 I'd also really love to be able to craft technical solutions myself. 
                 Probably what's most important is to being intellectually stimulated, to enjoy the work, whether I'm in Product Management, testing, developing, or even making money off my own app solutions!
            </p>
            <h2>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Always starting with the negative! I am easily distracted, and I‚Äôm a huge procrastinator. When the task is potentially unpleasant, or I have a negative emotional association with it, that can be debilitating. I also think I am generally reluctant to ask for help - I should work on that!
            </p>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> ehrm, being able to see the humorous side of things (mostly)? I think my past experiences with coding and problem solving have equipped me with a keenness to learn - at least at the time of writing, I don't have any problem flitting the hours away working on this course material (adjacent exploration and learning).
            </p>
            <h2>3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>Empathy, courage to be open/vulnerable, to be confident to ask for help, independence, motivation.              
            </p>
            <h2>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
            <pr><b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</b>
            <br>While I really don‚Äôt think there will be any issues here, I can never be sure how other people‚Äôs negative behaviours might affect me. I want to say that, before reacting negatively/defensively to something/someone, I‚Äôll try to be mindful of my feelings, take a breath, try to put myself in that person‚Äôs shoes.
            <br><br>
            <p><b>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</b>
              <br>I will try to get up, get a drink, go for a walk, do something else for a break. Breathe. Perhaps even try meditation.  I will also need to be motivated to keep healthy and active - not normally a problem, but I don‚Äôt want to go any more than a week without a run!
            </p>
            <h2>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
            <p>I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm supposed to answer here. How will I seek timely help? Well, while the chatbots or google are often enlightening, I need to be more open to ask for help among my peers and the facilitators.               
            </p>
            <h2>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team            </h2>
            <p>I expect the facilitators to be open to answering calls for help (and I have no doubt that they aren‚Äôt doing this!). I also expect them to be a little proactive, prompting us to see if we need any help - with the whole group is fine, but sometimes one might not be confident to open up to the group, so I expect facilitators to also privately reach out to students (at least a little).
            </p>
            <h2>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.           </h2>
            <p>Nothing concrete, except perhaps RAD sessions and Thursday run things.
