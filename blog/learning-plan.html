          This programme is not a traditional programme. It depends a lot on your motivation and organisation as a learner. This leads to a more individualised experience and increased learning skills moving forward. To facilitate this experience, each student creates a unique Learning Plan. <a href="https://student-handbook.devacademy.life/foundations/curriculum/sprint-2/02-human-skills/c1-cultural-blog-learning-plan">Click here</a>  to read more on the initial brief.

          <h2>1. Long term goal or career pathway</h2>
            <p>That's not an easy question. I suspect that given the current economic situation, like many folks, I've thought about this question a lot.
                 I enjoy working in tech, and I like living in Te Waipounamu (the South Island), particularly CHC.
                 I enjoy Product Management/Ownership, and enjoy scientific/technical domains, especially 'geospatial'. 
                 I'd also really love to be able to craft technical solutions myself. 
                 Probably what's most important is to being intellectually stimulated, to enjoy the work, whether I'm in Product Management, testing, developing, or even making money off my own app solutions!
            </p>
            <h2>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Always starting with the negative! I am easily distracted, and I’m a huge procrastinator. When the task is potentially unpleasant, or I have a negative emotional association with it, that can be debilitating. I also think I am generally reluctant to ask for help - I should work on that!
            </p>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> ehrm, being able to see the humorous side of things (mostly)? I think my past experiences with coding and problem solving have equipped me with a keenness to learn - at least at the time of writing, I don't have any problem flitting the hours away working on this course material (adjacent exploration and learning).
            </p>
            <h2>3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>Empathy, courage to be open/vulnerable, to be confident to ask for help, independence, motivation.              
            </p>
            <h2>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
            <b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</b>
            <p>While I really don’t think there will be any issues here, I can never be sure how other people’s negative behaviours might affect me. I want to say that, before reacting negatively/defensively to something/someone, I’ll try to be mindful of my feelings, take a breath, try to put myself in that person’s shoes.
            <b>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</b>
            <p>I will try to get up, get a drink, go for a walk, do something else for a break. Breathe. Perhaps even try meditation.  I will also need to be motivated to keep healthy and active - not normally a problem, but I don’t want to go any more than a week without a run!
            </p>
            <h2>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
            <p>I’m not sure what I’m supposed to answer here. How will I seek timely help? Well, while the chatbots or google are often enlightening, I need to be more open to ask for help among my peers and the facilitators.               
            </p>
            <h2>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team            </h2>
            <p>I expect the facilitators to be open to answering calls for help (and I have no doubt that they aren’t doing this!). I also expect them to be a little proactive, prompting us to see if we need any help - with the whole group is fine, but sometimes one might not be confident to open up to the group, so I expect facilitators to also privately reach out to students (at least a little).
            </p>
            <h2>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.           </h2>
            <p>Nothing concrete, except perhaps RAD sessions and Thursday run things.
