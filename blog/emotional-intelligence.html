        To kick-off, I want to highlight these different terms and their abbreviations:
        <ul>
            <li>Emotional Intelligence (EI)</li>
            <li>Emotional Quotient (EQ)</li>
            <li>Intelligence Quotient (EQ)</li>
          </ul>
       </p>


     <!-- question two -->
    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
        There’s a lot to delve into with this topic - as with anything psychology and intelligence-related, there are differing opinions, models, criticisms etc. This is not supposed to be an essay on Emotional Intelligence (EI), so I’ll try to keep it fairly succinct:
    </p>
    <p><i><b>noun</b></i><br>
    My interpretation is that, at its core, Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive how people feel and understand the way they react - importantly, this also includes perceiving and understanding one’s own emotions, and reactions/behaviours.
    <br>Definitions of EI typically expand this to include using that perception and understanding to improve one’s interactions with others, but also to control one’s own emotions and improve wellbeing.
    </p>

    <!-- question two -->
    <h2>How is EQ different <i>from</i> IQ?</h2>
    <p>
        Emotional Quotient (EQ) is one method that is used to measure Emotional Intelligence. Its name appears to be a counter to the popular Intelligence Quotient (IQ). IQ is designed to be a score of human intelligence, or more specifically, cognitive intelligence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Overall</b><br>
        IQ focuses on cognitive processes and is often seen as a predictor of academic and technical performance.
        <br>EQ focuses on emotional and social skills, which are crucial for interpersonal relationships, leadership, and overall life satisfaction.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Abilities</b><br>
        IQ attempts to measure logical reasoning, mathematical skills, spatial ability, language comprehension, and problem-solving skills.
        <br>EQ attempts to assess one’s self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Testing</b><br>
        IQ scores are derived from standardised tests, and scores are intended to be a comparison to the general human population.
        <br>EQ is often assessed through self-report questionnaires, behavioural assessments, and peer reviews.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Development</b><br>
        IQ scores are supposedly relatively stable throughout one’s adult life; while one can improve certain cognitive tasks, the overall innate cognitive abilities don’t change.
        <br>EQ abilities are said to be able to be improved over time with practice.
    </p>

    <!-- question three -->
    <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
    <p>
        I’m going to flip this around and ask <i>“Is EQ [specifically] important?”</i>
        <br>I would argue that Emotional Quotient isn’t necessarily very important! However, it could be considered useful in certain situations.
        <br>For example: assessing one’s Emotional Intelligence to get a baseline, actively working on improving important skills and abilities that are considered part of a general Emotional Intelligence (EI).
        </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps that question is supposed to be about EI instead? Well, that exactly how I’m going to interpret it!
        <br>...
    </p>

    <h2>Why is <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> important?</h2>
    <p>
        If you believe the proponents - and I’m not saying that I don’t, I’m just not an expert on this topic, so I don’t want to speak from a voice of authority - if you believe the researchers and proponents of Emotional Intelligence, the abilities that are associated with emotional intelligence are highly correlated with happiness, productivity, and life success.        
    </p>
    <p>
        Having high emotional intelligence skills can help with managing stress, building strong relationships, and navigating social complexities. They are associated with personal and professional success, especially in roles requiring leadership, collaboration, and communication.
    </p>
    <p>
        Turning this question back to this course, web development, even if a student were to want a hermit-like, low-interaction career as a developer, they still have to interact with other people at <i>some</i> level - so communication and empathy skills will go a LONG way. And, we’re all humans, regardless of our careers, we want to be happy (I don’t think anyone doesn’t!), so the self-awareness, mindfulness, and emotional-control skills are great for achieving happiness and personal success.
