### What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?  
Difficult to answer with any solid points here. Three? I can‚Äôt think of one\!  
The reflections, mindfulness, bringing attention to the importance of soft-skills and emotional intelligence. I have certainly gained a better understanding of myself: id, procrastination-emotions, ego, and I am trying to use the techniques we covered to better myself.  
Perhaps one slightly solid thing: when I‚Äôm battling to start something, it can be VERY useful to go for a run \- I have noticed that after several days without exercise I procrastinate more, and struggle to focus on new tasks.

### What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?  
**Self-awareness** and **empathy** in **programming** are fairly self-evident: one works with people, so being aware of one‚Äôs emotions, behaviours, and how they impact other people is incredibly important for being productive, but also for enjoying working with others.  For **learning**, it‚Äôs very valuable to be **self-aware** and have **empathy** for oneself; being able to recognise when frustration and other negative emotions are growing, not to beat oneself up, rather do something about it: go for a run, get a drink, pull some weeds from the garden\!  
**Values**? TBH, I didn‚Äôt *really* understand this topic so much, especially not for **learning**. Values for **programming**, ok sure, working with others, understanding how one‚Äôs own ‚Äúvalues‚Äù or ‚Äúworldview‚Äù may be similar or different to that of other folks‚Äô and being **self-aware** and **empathetic** enough not to let differences in values get in the way of collaboration; to focus positively on the things you have in common, rather than the things that divide‚Ä¶ Is that a good enough summary?

### What has surprised you the most about the ‚ÄòHuman Skills‚Äô learning?  
Probably how effective it has been for me. I did have some concerns about doing this course \- sure I think I am capable of learning the things, but can I overcome my tendency to procrastinate, enough to keep up with the pace? Well, maybe the Foundations weeks are *really* easy, but I have much more optimism about my capabilities now.  
I guess I have also been surprised by how applicable these skills are to other aspects in life \- not that I‚Äôve been applying them enough. As I‚Äôve written in several other reflections files/notes/blogs, even if I don‚Äôt come away from this course with solid, career-boosting skills in development, at least I can come away with a better understanding of myself, and hopefully the skills and motivation to continually better myself on the human-skills front.

### What were the most challenging aspects of the ‚ÄòHuman Skills‚Äô curricula?
Sharing. Publicly sharing quite personal information. I still don‚Äôt feel entirely comfortable about it to be honest\! I‚Äôm not particularly paranoid, at least not in the _alluminium-foil-hat-wearing_, or _encrypt-everything-lest-the-big-bad-government/corporations-use-it-against-you_ kinda way, but I am aware that our github pages are public (I assume they have to be for the purposes of sharing them amongst our cohort, and scraping them for assessment). I‚Äôve at least tried to prevent the search indexing robots from crawling over my pages \- I don‚Äôt really like the thought of random people on the internet reading my thoughts, and certainly don‚Äôt like the idea of would-be-scammers finding out more about me and weaponising it\!

### Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
Well, there‚Äôs what you guys have said before, maybe not on record(?), that employers want people who they can work with, and, allegedly, Dev Academy is well-regarded by NZ tech employers for producing grads who have better honed their human-skills than other institutions. Is that true? I‚Äôd like to believe so, it makes sense to me, but I don‚Äôt have any evidence for or against this notion so I can‚Äôt really draw much conclusion. A cynic might say that it is simply trying to fill a niche, capture a different market, one that is more open to the ‚Äúwoo‚Äù \- to be clear, that‚Äôs not what I actually think, I‚Äôm just trying to be empathetic, to play the devil‚Äôs advocate, donning [de Bono‚Äôs Black Hat](https://www.debono.com/six-thinking-hats-summary).

### Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
Nope. I feel like I‚Äôve already covered this, ad nauseam, above. However, since I seem to be prone to long-winded reflective answers \- ferociously verbose; verbosiousness \- I will oblige the question once more‚Ä¶  
I think the human skills are a really welcome break from the tech skills. I enjoy the change of thinking, the change of topic, and I wonder if the simple diversity of learning topics possibly helps with the learning of the tech stuff.   <span class="comment">Black Hat again‚Ä¶ but I feel like I‚Äôve been smashing the tech stuff, so maybe if I was struggling a lot more with that I‚Äôd have a different opinion?</span>
