        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p><b>Neuroplasticity</b> is the idea that the brain is not &lsquo;fixed&rsquo;, that it is &lsquo;plastic&rsquo; it can change and be &ldquo;remoulded". Not to be confused with plastic - the hydrocarbon polymers that we build things out of.&nbsp; Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This ability allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, learning, and even recovery from injury. Neuroplasticity underpins how we acquire new skills, change habits, and how our brain evolves in response to environmental changes, highlighting its dynamic and flexible nature.</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Growth mindset</b>, in a nutshell, is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, hard work, and learning from feedback. It contrasts with a fixed mindset, where one assumes their abilities are static. A growth mindset encourages resilience, a passion for learning, and the belief that effort leads to mastery, fostering personal and professional growth.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <br>

        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity">Useful link</a> <span class ="comment"> Ok, it seems like a cop-out, but Wikipedia is often a really useful place to <b><i>start</i></b> researching a topic!</span></p>
        <p><b>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</b> because it reveals that the brain is capable of change at any stage of life. This knowledge can empower individuals to take an active role in their learning, recovery from brain injuries, or even overcoming negative habits and thought patterns. It also opens up possibilities for continuous personal growth, mental resilience, and adapting to new challenges, whether through learning new skills or improving mental well-being.</p>
        <p><b>Ways to increase neuroplasticity:</b></p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Learning new skills</b> (eg languages, musical instruments, or picking up a new hobby)</li>
        <li><b>Physical exercise</b> - this can boost brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein linked to brain health.</li>
        <li><b>Quality sleep</b> - helps to consolidate learning and memory.</li>
        <li><b>Mindfulness and meditation.</b></li>
        <li><b>Socialising.</b></li>
        <li><b>Mental challenges</b> - eg puzzles</li>
        <li><b>Managing stress</b> - chronic stress can negatively impact it, so the counter is to manage it!</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
        <p><b>Why is it relevant?</b> Well, its relevance to this web development course seems fairly obvious. As the literature says, if one has a fixed mindset, they are more likely to give up when a challenge presents itself that pushes one outside their comfort zone. In contrast, one with a growth mindset is more likely to take enjoyment in the challenge, ultimately resulting in higher learning performance.</p>
        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/M1CHPnZfFmU?si=QJcKOp3_JMRxmPDq">This video from John Spencer</a> seems to give a good overview comparing Fixed and Growth mindsets.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Applying these to myself</h1>
        <p>While I was already aware of these concepts, I don't regularly think about them. It is always useful to reflect on how I could be applying these to better myself, not just to this course, but to help improve many other aspects of my life.</p>
        
        <p>These topics are certainly making a case for all the human skills content that is being covered in this course. I am quite enjoying the balance, and I think that, even if I don't come away from this course with a passion to pursue a career in web development, I will highly value the understanding and practises here. I will aim to keep up my physical exercise, meditation, being mindful of my emotions, and attempt to be more enthusiastic when facing challenges.</p>
        
        <p>I was really not in the mood for research and writing first thing Monday morning! But, I pushed through, and decided to try to avoid the behaviours associated with a Fixed Mindset!</p>

        <p>Researching and writing about these concepts has sparked a bit of curiosity when I reflect on the topics I covered a week ago: <a href="https://zak-hynd.github.io/blog/emotional-intelligence.html">Emotional Intelligence</a> So it's argued that with a fixed mindset, cognitive ability is innate, and unchanging; the abilities assessed in IQ tests are generally considered to be relatively unchanging throughout adulthood. On the surface of it, there appears to be a contradiction here - worth exploring more.</p>
        
        <p>Another curiosity concerning neuroplasticity and language learning is the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)">Genie.</a> She NEVER learned to talk as a consequence of the extreme social isolation in her childhood. Research suggests that after puberty it becomes significantly more difficult, if not impossible, to develop native-like linguistic abilities. After this period, the brain's neuroplasticity for language learning diminishes.</p>
